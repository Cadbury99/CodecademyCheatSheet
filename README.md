How to add links, images, videos and fonts to HTML and CSS<br><br>
My renditions of the Codecademy Cheat Sheet, found <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path/tracks/fecp-web-development-fundamentals/modules/fecp-challenge-project-build-your-own-cheat-sheet/projects/independent-project-html-documentation">here</a>. Suggestions and edits are welcome as this is my first project without step-by-step instructions.
